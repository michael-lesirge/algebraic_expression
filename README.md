# algebraic_expression

This is a python module designed to be used to make other projects.
It allows you to make algebraic expressions with many variables and exponents.
It was made mainly as a fun project and to help me cheat in my math class along with my other [math class calculators](https://github.com/michael-lesirge/math-class-calculators-2022)
Hope you find this helpful. There are defently some bugs so don't use if for anything import tho.
